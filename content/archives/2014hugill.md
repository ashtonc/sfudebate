## Resolutions
 * **Round 1**: THW prohibit aboriginal bands from banning non-members living on reserve.
 * **Round 2**: TH, being the NCAA, would allow universities to pay college athletes.
 * **Round 3**: While exploring the remains of a Soviet-era forced labour camp north of the town of Voru, Estonian officials have discovered a cache of fully-operational intercontinental ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads. TH would keep the missiles.
 * **Round 4**: THW lower the standard of proof for cases of rape and sexual assault from beyond a reasonable doubt to a preponderance of the evidence.
 * **Round 5**: TH prefers a world where space exploration is funded by private companies rather than governments.
 * **Semis**: THW not apply competition law to digital economic activity.
 * **Final**: TH, as King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, would ban members of the Islamic State from ever making the Hajj.

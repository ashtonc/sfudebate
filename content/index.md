# SFU Debate

Welcome to the website for the SFU Debate Society. We are a competitive club that represents SFU at debate competitions in many different styles. We compete in tournaments across North America and host debate tournaments annually.

## Join

If you would like to join our club, just stop by one of our meetings! Membership is completely free, and new debaters will be taught everything they need to know. You are welcome to observe as many debates as you would like debates before participating in one yourself.

## Contact Us

General inquires and questions may be emailed to [debate.sfu@gmail.com](mailto:debate.sfu@gmail.com). Feel free to also connect with us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SFUDebateSociety).
